# Spam-Email-Classification
Python-based spam email classifier using logistic regression with scikit-learn and pandas for text processing.

Overview

This project develops a Python-based machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using logistic regression. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis, employing scikit-learn for modeling and pandas for data processing. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a system for classifying new email inputs, demonstrating potential for email filtering applications.

Dataset
Features: Email message text.
Target: Category (0 = Spam, 1 = Ham).
